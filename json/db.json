  "description": "A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid those with blindness or autism, act as a therapy dog, or perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies.   The breed is best known for their obedience, loyalty, and playful composure. Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs. Originally used in Newfoundland, as fishing dogs, they would help bring in the fishing nets and retrieve fish that had gotten away.",
